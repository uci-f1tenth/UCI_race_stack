# F1Tenth @ UCI Workshop Repo

# Introduction

We add [DreamerV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104) implementations of World Models into the F1tenth ROS2 environment in PyTorch. Referenced [dreamerv3-torch](https://github.com/NM512/dreamerv3-torch), [racing_dreamer](https://github.com/CPS-TUWien/racing_dreamer), and [dreamerv3](https://github.com/danijar/dreamerv3) repositories for the base code.
