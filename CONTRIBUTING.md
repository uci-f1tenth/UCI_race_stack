## Setup Instructions for Racecar Gym Environment(Recommended).

To use the Racercar Gym Environment, you must download [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

After installation, you can troubleshoot using the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#projects).

To run the code use:

```bash
uv run run.py
```

## Setup Instructions for ROS gym environment(Optional).

To use the NoVNC script for remote visualization of your simulations, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using SSH(HTTP will not grant you access for direct commits)

```bash
git clone "git@github.com:uci-f1tenth/uci_f1tenth_workshop.git"
```

Go into the gym directory you installed the program in.

```bash
cd uci-f1tenth-workshop/f1tenth_gym_ros
```

Run shell script:

```bash
sh scripts/run.sh
```

Open a web browser and go to link

```bash
http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
```

Run the ROS within the VM hosted in the docker simulator and run

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/local_setup.bash
```

Launch the simulation

```bash
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```

### Building a node

After you run the above scrips, your terminal would be busy running the gym_bridge_launch.py. Hence, pull up a new terminal window and go to the project directory BEFORE you run the below commands.

\*To build a node in ROS2, you must be within the vm root.
If you are not in the machine either run the script again, or run:

```bash
docker exec -it f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1 /bin/bash
```

Source two environments under /sim_ws/:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Run the build command under with your node name in setup.py

```bash
colcon build --packages-select your_node
```

Source the workspace environment again

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Run the node with the executable

```bash
ros2 run your_package your_executable
```

### Example execution of the dreamer node

After you run the above scrips, your terminal would be busy running the gym_bridge_launch.py. Hence, pull up a new terminal window and go to the project directory BEFORE you run the below commands.

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select dreamer_node
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run dreamer_node dreamer_node
```

## Data Visualization

### Tensorboard

Open a new terminal window and run the following command.

```bash
%tensorboard --logdir .\logdir\f1tenth
```

This will run tensorboard at http://localhost:6006/.
